                I've decided I want to make this thing boring, because hopefully my teacher will only look at the coding and let me live happily ever after with this coding project that I probably will never look at again, once I'm finished with it. I'm actually listening to music while I'm writing this information down, and listening to music is one of my hobbies. Also, btw, the artist is called "Why don't we". You should check them out, cause it's a sick group. Anyway, back to hobbies. I sing. A lot. I try to be modest, and tell people I'm not really good, and things like that, but it's so annoying! I already know I'm really good, but I keep on denying it, and I end up looking stupid. So, I guess I better say that I am very good at singing and can sing almost every ENGLISH song very well. Another hobby is reading. And another is talking. I talk. A lot. I could definetly pass as the voice behind blabbermouth.com. Anyway, that's all from me. Oh, and my nickname is Ika, by the way. Cause my name is Ritika, and Ika is from the last bit of my name. So yea. Bai!

        MY FAV SONGS AND ARTISTS 
    </h1>
    <p>
        My fav songs are usually by Why Don't We. I'm also currently into KDA. I'm not much of a K-pop fan, but KDA makes an exception. I also enjoy listening to "La da dee" by Cody Simpson. I have too many songs that I like, so I'll leave that at that.

    <h1> MY IDOLS</h1>
    <p> I really really like Evelynn from KDA. I'm also really into Lego Ninjago, as you'll soon find out. My fav charactor from LN is probably Zane Julien. He's a nindroid. I'm also quite fond of Elavenil Valarivan, who is an Tamil gun shooter. Yup, I love weapons. My main idols in life though, are my family and friends. Without them, I wouldn't be where I am right now (even though I have absolutley no idea where I am).

    <h1> MY FAV SHOWS</h1>
    <p>
        Okay, so. I am a REALLY big fan of Lego Ninjago. I adore Zane Julien, who is a robot/nindroid and his partner Pixal. I. LOVE. THEM. I also really like Jay Walker, but I like the old Jay better because the new Jay is just a little bit...er...not smart?? I used to be really fond of Kai Smith, because I liked his hair. But now he's my somewhat ok character favourite. My bestie really likes Cole Brookstone, and I do too. You know, Cole is the most underrated charcater in LN. Cole and Kai are really underrated. But you know who's overrated? Lloyd Montgomery Garmadon, that's who. Just because he's the Green Ninja, doesn't mean he needs to get 80% of the seasons to himself. The most un-used character would be Nya. She's only got two seasons to herself, so far. And even though she's a ninja, you can barely see her do anything. I guess Zane is under-used too. The Rebooted season was the SADDEST season EVER. Rebooted and Uncharted. Those two seasons are plain sad, because Zane gives up half his heart to save the girl he loves, and then dies for her in Rebooted (but then is rebuilt, because did I mention he is a robot??). Nya dies in Uncharted, because she gave up her life in order to save Jay (her husband) and makes Jay cry. A lot. I also cried when I watched those seasons. But the Prime Empire season was just funny. It's almost a joke. Heh.
